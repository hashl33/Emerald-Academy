Chapter 2 Day 2 

Q1: Explain why we wouldn't call changeGreeting in a script.
A1: A script does not modify the code, so changeGreeting wouldn't be called in a script. 

Q2: What does the AuthAccount mean in the prepare phase of the transaction?
A2: The AuthAccount is the account where the data/nft is stored. The prepare phase lets us access the data in the AuthAccount.

Q3: What is the difference between the prepare phase and the execute phase in the transaction?
A3: The prepare phase is necessary to access the data and the code could also be executed here, but to make the code intention clear, the execute phase is separated. The execute       phase cannot access the data on its own.
