### Describe what an event is, and why it might be useful to a client.
  When an event occurs in a smart contract a message is emitted to the outside world/client. Events are defined within the contract and then sent out as an emit. 
  
  Events could be useful in an nft marketplace to update recent sales, listings, price changes etc. 
  
  Personal thoughts: It seems the Cadence NFT Standard requires events for contract
  initialization and deposit/withdraw functions. I'm curious which events are typically included on top of the initial 3. Is "listed for sale" an event? Or does this event
  happen in the marketplace contract?
