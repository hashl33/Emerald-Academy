## What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
  1) Safety and Security
  2) Clarity
  3) Approachability
  4) Developer Experience
  5) Resource Oriented Programming
## In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
The 5 pillars are laying the foundation for a pleasant experience for developers as well as future clients/users. By making the langguage clear, consise and easy to
read/comprehend developers can master the language and build incredible things without getting bogged down with hard to maintain spaghetti code. Also, with most contracts 
being public on the blockchain, the readability makes it easier to spot bad actors as well as hold developers accountable.
