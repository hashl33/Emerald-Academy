# 1. What does .link() do?
  .link() creates a, well, link to the /storage/ path so that the linked data is exposed to the public (or private)
  
  Using .link() looks like this: signer.link<&MyContract.MyResource>(/public/MyTestResource, target: /storage/MyTestResource)

# 2. In your own words (no code), explain how we can use resource interfaces to only expose certain things to the /public/ path.


# 3. Deploy a contract that contains a resource that implements a resource interface. Then, do the following:
    -In a transaction, save the resource to storage and link it to the public with the restrictive interface.
    -Run a script that tries to access a non-exposed field in the resource interface, and see the error pop up.
    -Run the script and access something you CAN read from. Return it from the script.
