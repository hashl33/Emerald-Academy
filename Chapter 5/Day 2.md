Explain why standards can be beneficial to the Flow ecosystem.
 Standards are important to add a layer of security to contracts, on both the account holders side and on the user side. Also, in order to grow the Flow eco-system, people 
 building future tools need to expect certain events, resources etc., and if there is no standard in place, there will be a lot more work for future builders, which may 
 mean the work just doesn't get done. For example, if find.xyz had to examine each nft contract and there were no standards in place, I doubt the fine devs at .find 
 would be able to add new projects so quickly. This also goes for tooling such as the Emerald Bot, Schwwap.IO, etc.
